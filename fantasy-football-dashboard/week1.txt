1. Draft Storyline & Trends
The "Post-Keeper Value Hunt" Draft
With elite talent locked up as keepers, this draft became about finding the next tier of players and gambling on upside. The removal of consensus top players (Puka, Bowers, etc.) from the draft pool created a fascinating dynamic where managers had to pivot strategies entirely.
Key Positional Trends:
WR Premium Intensified: With limited elite WRs available, teams reached aggressively
QB Polarization: Some paid premium for top tier QBs while others punted completely
Rookie Gambling: Heavy investment in rookies to find keeper-level talent for next year
TE Scarcity: With Bowers/Hockenson kept, remaining TEs became more valuable

2. Top 3 Highest Value Picks 
1. A.J. Brown - #12 (Round 1, Pick 12) - akhilmetukuru
Adjusted ADP: ~6th available - With keepers removed, Brown should go much earlier than 12th pick
2. Trey McBride - #28 (Round 3, Pick 4) - audumula
Adjusted ADP: ~20th available - Premium TE option with Brock Bowers kept
3. Sam Laporta - #55 (Round 7, Pick 11) - abhishekD
Adjusted ADP: ~20th available - Top 4 TE option that ended up falling down the board

3. Top 3 Biggest Reaches (vs. Keeper-Adjusted ADP)
1. Aaron Jones - #39 (Round 4, Pick 10) - kulkdaddy47
Keeper-Adjusted ADP: ~65th available - Drafted ~26 picks ahead of where he should go with keepers removed.
2. Breece Hall - #10 (Round 1, Pick 10) - kulkdaddy47
Keeper-Adjusted ADP: ~25th available - Drafted ~15 picks ahead with injury concerns and keeper adjustments.
3. Josh Allen - #16 (Round 2, Pick 9) - audumula
Keeper-Adjusted ADP: ~28th available - Drafted ~12 picks ahead of adjusted QB market.

5. Power Rankings

Final Assessment
Managers like Pranav Jain, Sahit Reddi, Sahil Parikh, Taaha Motorwala, and Roshik Datla maximized their keeper advantages by building around them while also adding an elite 1st round talent. They are undoubtedly the favorites heading into the season
Draft grades and power rankings are merely starting points - once Week 1 kicks off, none of this analysis matters. Fantasy football's beautiful chaos means the team ranked 12th could easily hoist the championship trophy while the "best" draft crumbles under the weight of injuries, busts, and bad luck. Teams receiving lower grades can use this as bulletin board material to prove the doubters wrong. Conversely, highly-ranked teams face the burden of living up to expectations - some will embrace the target on their backs and dominate, while others will fold when their "sure thing" players disappoint. Remember, championships aren't won in August drafts but through 17 weeks of smart waiver wire moves, shrewd trades, lineup decisions, and catching breaks when it matters most. Every single team in this league has a legitimate path to the title - it's just a matter of who executes best once the games begin.
