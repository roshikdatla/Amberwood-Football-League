                With elite talent locked up as keepers, this year's draft became about finding the next tier of players and gambling on upside. 
                The removal of consensus top players (Puka, Bowers, etc.) from the draft pool created a fascinating dynamic where managers had 
                to pivot strategies entirely.

              Managers like Pranav Jain, Sahit Reddi, Sahil Parikh, Taaha Motorwala, and Roshik Datla 
              maximized their keeper advantages by building around them while also adding an elite 1st round talent. 
              They are undoubtedly the favorites heading into the season.

              Draft grades and power rankings are merely starting points - once Week 1 kicks off, none of this 
              analysis matters. Fantasy football's beautiful chaos means the team ranked 12th could easily hoist 
              the championship trophy while the "best" draft crumbles under the weight of injuries, busts, and bad luck.

            <p className="assessment-text">
              Remember, championships aren't won in August drafts but through 17 weeks of smart waiver wire moves, 
              shrewd trades, lineup decisions, and catching breaks when it matters most. Every single team in this 
              league has a legitimate path to the title - it's just a matter of who executes best once the games begin.
