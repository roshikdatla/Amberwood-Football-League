                  <h4>"SAHIT TAKES SOLE POSSESSION: SahitReddi Dethrones audumula"</h4>
                  <p><strong>SahitReddi (136.03) def. audumula (126.89)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Jaxson Dart and Devante Adams powered SahitReddi to a crucial 9-point victory in the battle of 6-3 teams. Moving to 7-3 and taking sole possession of second place, this win keeps them firmly in control of their playoff destiny with just four weeks remaining!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> audumula's Trey McBride (27.7) had a monster game, but Josh Allen (19.34) and the receiving corps couldn't keep pace with SahitReddi's balanced attack. Dropping to 6-4, they fall out of the top-3 for the first time in weeks. Still in a solid playoff position, but the margin for error is shrinking fast with a crowded 6-4 logjam forming.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"STATEMENT WIN: abhishekD Outlasts roshik in Crucial Playoff Battle"</h4>
                  <p><strong>abhishekD (137.22) def. roshik (128.50)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Drake London (24.4) and the receiver room carried the load in the crucial 8.72-point victory. Moving to 6-4, this is a MASSIVE head-to-head win over a fellow bubble team. abhishekD is clinging to that 5-seed with everything they've got!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> roshik's Matthew Stafford (26.9) and Kyren Williams (22.4) put up solid numbers, but it wasn't enough against abhishekD's firepower. Falling to 4-6, their playoff hopes are on life support. With only 1311 points scored, the wild card isn't an option—they need to win out and pray for chaos.</p>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"ANKITHE CRUISES: Dominant Victory Solidifies Wild Card Position"</h4>
                  <p><strong>ankithe (145.90) def. taahakm (115.07)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Ladd McConkey (20.7) and Caleb Williams (25.1) led ankithe to a commanding 30-point victory. Moving to 6-4 with 1405 points scored, ankithe is now in command of 3rd place with a solid buffer in PF. What a performance!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> taahakm's Jahmyr Gibbs (38.2) exploded for the second-highest individual score of Week 10, but the rest of the roster was MIA in the 115-point effort. Dropping to 3-7, they're officially eliminated from playoff contention. At least Gibbs showed up for the highlight reel!</p>

                  <h4>"SAHIL SURVIVES: swahili28 Edges abhiu in Low-Stakes Matchup"</h4>
                  <p><strong>swahili28 (130.59) def. abhiu (120.50)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Nico Collins (22.60) and Seahawks DST (24.25) led swahili28 to a 10-point victory, moving to 5-5 and keeping playoff hopes alive. With 1393 points scored (4th in league), they're very much in the playoff hunt if they can string together some wins. Every game is a must-win from here on out!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> abhiu's Justin Jefferson and Bo Nix couldn't generate enough firepower in the loss. Falling to 2-8, the season is mercifully almost over. At 1220 points scored with no path to the playoffs, it's time to embrace the tank and play spoiler.</p>

                  <p><strong>pranav4789 (172.85) def. akhilmetukuru (131.45)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> HOLY SMOKES! 172.85 POINTS! De'Von Achane (40.5) and Treveyon Henderson (28.00) led an absolute CLINIC—the second-highest scoring performance of the season! pranav4789 moves to 5-5 but MORE IMPORTANTLY sits at 1430 points scored—THE HIGHEST IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE! The wild card spot is theirs to lose!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> akhilmetukuru's Jonathan Taylor (49.6 points—HIGHEST INDIVIDUAL SCORE OF WEEK 10!) absolutely went OFF, and they STILL lost by 41 points. Dropping to 3-7, they're eliminated despite JT's heroics. That's the cruel reality of fantasy football—sometimes even 131 points and a 50-burger from your RB1 isn't enough!</p>

                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Jaxson Smith-Njigba (20.3) and co handled business against a completely absent kulkdaddy47 lineup. Moving to 7-3 and taking sole possession of first place, pranavj20 is in complete control. With 1401 points scored and a 7-3 record, their eyes are set on getting the first round bye week.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> 76.08 POINTS?! IN WEEK 10?! kulkdaddy47 just laid the biggest egg of the season and dropped to 6-4 after being tied for first place last week. DK Metcalf (6.5), Keenan Allen (3.9), and T.J. Hockenson (2.8) were complete busts. This isn't just a loss—it's a CATASTROPHE that could haunt them the rest of the way!</p>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <p><strong>Winner: kulkdaddy47 (aditya)</strong></p>
                  <p>Folks, we have a new standard for embarrassment. kulkdaddy47 scored a season-low 76.08 points in Week 10—a performance so bad it makes you question if they checked their lineup!</p>
                  <p>The disaster was led by:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>DK Metcalf: 6.5 points (bust alert!)</li>
                    <li>Keenan Allen: 3.9 points (complete disappearing act)</li>
                    <li>T.J. Hockenson: 2.8 points (fantasy football nightmare)</li>
                    <li>Michael Pittman Jr.: 3.9 points (another complete dud)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Multiple starters were complete busts, and the entire roster decided to take a collective nap while pranavj20 beat them by nearly 60 points. This wasn't a game—it was a public execution.</p>
                  <p>What makes this even MORE painful? kulkdaddy47 was TIED FOR FIRST PLACE last week at 6-3. One week later, they're 6-4 and falling fast in the standings after the most embarrassing performance of the season.</p>

            <div className="matchup-result">
              <h4>THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL GAME: SahitReddi (136.03) def. audumula (126.89)</h4>
              <p>This was THE game of the week for playoff implications. Both teams entered at 6-3 and tied for the top spots. SahitReddi's 9-point victory was absolutely massive because:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>SahitReddi (7-3) now has sole possession of 2nd place and some breathing room for the first round bye.</li>
                <li>audumula (6-4) falls into a four-way tie at 6-4 and drops from 3rd to 4th place, making their path to a top-5 seed more difficult. They are still in the drivers seat to make the playoffs, but cant afford to stumble much more</li>
                <li>With four teams now at 6-4 (audumula, ankithe, abhishekD, kulkdaddy47), this loss could be the difference between making the playoffs and missing them entirely</li>
              </ul>
              <p>audumula now faces an uphill battle—they need to win more games than the other 6-4 teams to secure a top-5 spot, and they no longer control their own destiny for a top-2 seed. Meanwhile, SahitReddi has breathing room and is nearly locked into the playoffs.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="section-headline">🔮 Fantasy Playoff Picture Preview</h2>

            <div className="power-rankings-section">
              <div className="teams-grid">
                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>ankithe (6-4, 1405 PF) - Playoff Probability: 85%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs swahili28, Week 12 vs abhiu, Week 13 vs SahitReddi, Week 14 vs pranavj20</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> ankithe is sitting pretty with the second highest points scored in the league (1405). Even at 6-4, they have a path to the wild card spot if they string together some losses. The schedule is manageable with a winnable game against abhiu (2-8) in Week 12, but the Week 13 matchup against SahitReddi (7-3) will be a statement game. If they go 2-2 or better, they're almost guaranteed a playoff spot either through a top-5 record or the wild card. The points cushion gives them a massive safety net.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> Win 2 of the next 4 games to get to 8-6, which should be enough for a top-5 spot. Even at 7-7 or 6-8, the wild card is possible if they maintain their scoring.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>swahili28 (5-5, 1393 PF) - Playoff Probability: 48%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs ankithe, Week 12 vs taahakm, Week 13 vs akhilmetukuru, Week 14 vs roshik</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> swahili28 sits at 5-5 but has the 4th-highest points scored (1393), keeping them very much alive for the wild card. The problem? They're currently behind both pranav4789 (1430) and ankithe (1405) in the wild card race. The schedule is favorable with winnable games against taahakm (3-7), akhilmetukuru (3-7), and roshik (4-6). They NEED to win at least 3 of 4 to get to 8-6 or 9-5 and sneak into the top-5.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> Must go at least 3-1 to finish 8-6 and have a shot at the top-5. If they finish 7-7 or worse, they'll need ankithe or pranav4789 to collapse AND need to outscore them in points to steal the wild card.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>abhishekD (6-4, 1313 PF) - Playoff Probability: 42%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs akhilmetukuru, Week 12 vs pranav4789, Week 13 vs audumula, Week 14 vs kulkdaddy47</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Here's the problem: abhishekD is 6-4 but has just 1313 points scored, which is 6th among playoff hopefuls. They CAN'T rely on the wild card, so they MUST win games to secure a top-5 spot. The schedule has a winnable Week 11 (akhilmetukuru 3-7), then three tough matchups against 5-5+ teams. They likely need to go 3-1 to finish 9-5 and feel safe.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> Win 3 of 4 to reach 9-5, which should lock up a top-5 spot. At 8-6, they'll be sweating on tiebreakers. At 7-7 or worse, they're likely out unless everyone else collapses. No wild card safety net here—it's win or go home.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>audumula (6-4, 1366 PF) - Playoff Probability: 63%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs pranavj20, Week 12 vs kulkdaddy47, Week 13 vs abhishekD, Week 14 vs pranav4789</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> audumula was in COMPLETE CONTROL last week, tied with the best record in the league. However, after a critical loss last week, they are right back in the thick of the logjam. Though they have strong path to playoffs, a cold streak now could absolutely crater their chances of the playoffs.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> Win 2 of the next 4 and continue strong scoring should ensure a top 5 finish. Points are on par with the rest of the logjam so they will likely have to pick up the scoring if they pick up loses and begin chasing for the wildcard spot.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>kulkdaddy47 (6-4, 1291 PF) - Playoff Probability: 35%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs sahitreddi, Week 12 vs audumula, Week 13 vs pranav4789, Week 14 vs abhishekD</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Similar to audumula, kulkdaddy47 was tied for the best record in the league. However, after a disastrous performance this week scoring only 76 points, he tanked all the way out of the playoffs. If last week was any indicator of what's to come, I'd be extremely worried.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> After that terrible showing last week, kulkdaddy47 has ruled himself out of wildcard contention. He is in a very similar position to abhishekD where he will need to win 3 of his next 4 games to feel confident in making the playoffs. The chances of going 3-1 in the next 4 weeks are low given the difficulty of most of those matchups.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>pranav4789 (5-5, 1430 PF) - Playoff Probability: 80%</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> Week 11 vs roshik, Week 12 vs abhishekD, Week 13 vs kulkdaddy47, Week 14 vs audumula</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Despite being 5-5, pranav4789 has the HIGHEST POINTS SCORED IN THE LEAGUE (1430). They are the HEAVY favorite for the wild card spot. Even if they finish 6-8, they'll likely have the wild card locked up unless ankithe goes on an absolute tear. The schedule has a winnable Week 11 (roshik 4-6), then three tough matchups against 6-4 teams, so getting to 8-6 or 7-7 through wins won't be easy. But here's the thing: THEY DON'T NEED TO WIN. They just need to keep scoring points and protect that wild card cushion.</p>
                  <p><strong>Path to Playoffs:</strong> The wild card is 88% theirs already. Just keep scoring points and don't get leapfrogged by ankithe (1405) or swahili28 (1393). Even at 5-9 or 6-8, if they maintain the points lead, they're in. This team should be booking playoff hotels already.</p>
