                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"CARDIAC ARREST CENTRAL: audumula Escapes by the Skin of Their Teeth"</h4>
                  <p><strong>audumula (158.00) def. swahili28 (154.25)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> HOLY MOLY! Josh Allen (28.82) and Rico Dowdle (28.1) combined for 57 points in what might be the sweatiest 3.75-point victory of the season. audumula probably didn't breathe for the last three hours of Monday Night Football. Now 6-3 and tied for first, they'll take nail-biter wins all day long—this is playoff football, baby!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> This is PEAK fantasy football pain. swahili28 drops to 4-5 despite putting up 154 points—a score that would've beaten FOUR other teams this week. With 1262 points scored (2nd in the entire league!), they're living in fantasy purgatory. Someone check on this manager, they might be punching air right now.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"GIANT SLAYER ALERT: abhishekD Shocks the World!"</h4>
                  <p><strong>abhishekD (156.85) def. pranavj20 (150.06)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> UPSET CITY! Sam Darnold (27.2) and Drake London (38.8) just walked into the league leader's house and took their lunch money! abhishekD moves to 5-4 with a statement win that has the whole league on notice. When Drake London is cooking like this, this team is DANGEROUS. The 5-seed is calling their name!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> The empire strikes... out? pranavj20's Lamar Jackson (25.56) and Puka Nacua (22.8) played well, but sometimes you just run into a buzzsaw. Still 6-3 with 1265 points (league-leading), but this loss is a wake-up call. The crown is getting heavy, and everyone's coming for it.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"NUCLEAR EXPLOSION: roshik Drops 170 and Obliterates abhiu"</h4>
                  <p><strong>roshik (169.89) def. abhiu (91.22)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> 🚨 BROCK BOWERS ALERT 🚨 43.3 POINTS! THE HIGHEST INDIVIDUAL SCORE OF WEEK 9! Add in Matthew Stafford's 26.84, and roshik just put up a BONKERS 169.89-point masterpiece that sent shockwaves through the league. This is the kind of nuclear explosion that changes seasons. At 4-5, roshik just announced to the entire league: "WE'RE NOT DEAD YET!" This team is SCARY when they're clicking!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> Yikes. Yikes. YIKES. A 78-point beatdown that was over by halftime. abhiu's lineup laid an absolute egg, getting demolished by nearly 80 points. Now 2-7, the season is effectively over, but hey—at least they have a front-row seat to witness Brock Bowers' party? Silver linings?</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"HIGHWAY ROBBERY: ankithe Steals Victory from the Bye Week Gods"</h4>
                  <p><strong>ankithe (133.47) def. akhilmetukuru (73.65)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Christian McCaffrey (34.3) went OFF, but let's be honest—this win asterisk is the size of Texas! ankithe improves to 5-4 with the league's highest points scored (1259), putting them in prime wild card position. But the real MVP? akhilmetukuru's THREE players who scored ZERO POINTS. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> The fantasy football gods are CRUEL. akhilmetukuru started THREE players on bye weeks or injured, essentially forfeiting 30+ points before kickoff even happened. That's not a lineup—that's a white flag! At 3-6 with the most points against (1307), this team can't catch a break. Time to set those lineup notifications even on halloweekend, folks!</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"WORKMANLIKE: kulkdaddy47 Grinds Out Victory to Stay Atop Standings"</h4>
                  <p><strong>kulkdaddy47 (104.95) def. taahakm (88.00)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> Not pretty. Not flashy. Just a good old-fashioned 17-point grinder that keeps kulkdaddy47 at 6-3 and tied for first place. Sometimes you don't need fireworks—you just need to WIN, baby! The roster delivered balanced contributions in the lowest-scoring win of the week, but who cares? They're tied for first and that's all that matters!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> taahakm drops to 3-6 with just 88 points in a week where teams were dropping 160+. Dead last in points scored (1029) all season, this offense has been stuck in neutral since Week 1. With five games left, they need divine intervention, a meteor strike on the top-5, and probably a miracle or three to make playoffs.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"STATEMENT MADE: SahitReddi Annihilates Competition, Joins First Place Party"</h4>
                  <p><strong>SahitReddi (163.19) def. pranav4789 (120.71)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> THE OFFENSE IS CLICKING! SahitReddi's roster went NUCLEAR with 163 points, absolutely steamrolling pranav4789 by 42 points. Multiple players had monster weeks in this complete team effort. Now 6-3 and tied for first with 1253 points scored, this team is peaking at the PERFECT time. Championship vibes are STRONG with this one!</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> pranav4789 put up a respectable 120 points and it wasn't even CLOSE. That's the kind of soul-crushing loss that makes you question everything. Dropping to 4-5 but sitting on 1257 points (3rd in league), they're the poster child for "good team, bad luck." The wild card spot is screaming their name—just survive and let the points do the talking!</p>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <p><strong>Winner: ankithe</strong></p>
                  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new sheriff of lucky town! ankithe cruised to a 60-point victory over akhilmetukuru, but let's pump the brakes on the celebration—their opponent started THREE players who put up a combined ZERO POINTS due to bye weeks and injuries!</p>
                  <p>That's right, folks. akhilmetukuru essentially played with 70% of a roster and any other team in the league would have came away with a W. Meanwhile, ankithe is over here collecting a W like they just won the Super Bowl. Christian McCaffrey (34.3) did his thing sure, but this is like dunking on an empty hoop and celebrating.</p>
                  <p>Don't get it twisted—ankithe is 5-4 with a respectable points for (1259), so they're legit. But THIS week? Pure, unfiltered, Mickey Mouse magic. Sometimes you'd rather be lucky than good, and this week, ankithe was both!</p>

            <h2 className="section-headline">🏆 Power Rankings (Post-Week 9)</h2>

            <div className="power-rankings-section">
              <h3>Tier 1: Playoff Locks</h3>
              <div className="teams-grid">
                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>1. pranavj20 (6-3) - Playoff Probability: 99%</h4>
                  <p>Leading the league with 1265 points scored while sitting at 6-3. Once considered by far and away the best team in the league, they have now dropped 2 games in a row. Some may think this is just a blip in the road, but we see a pattern of issues and would not be shocked if they didn't lead the standings at the end of the regular season.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>2. SahitReddi (6-3) - Playoff Probability: 98%</h4>
                  <p>Tied for first at 6-3 with 1253 points scored (5th in league). The combination of wins and elite scoring makes them a near-lock for playoffs through either the top-5 or wild card route. What's most impressive is their form the past 6 weeks</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>3. audumula (6-3) - Playoff Probability: 97%</h4>
                  <p>At 6-3 with 1240 points, they're firmly in the top-5 mix. Even if they slide, their point total keeps them in wild card contention as a safety net. Similar to SahitReddi, we see a strong trend in the play the last 4 weeks. A true dark horse for the #1 seed as they are peaking at truly the perfect time.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>4. kulkdaddy47 (6-3) - Playoff Probability: 90%</h4>
                  <p>Tied for first at 6-3, though their 1215 points scored is fourth among the leaders. The wins are there to stay in the top-5, but they have the weakest wild card safety net of the 6-3 teams. The one team at 6-3 that could fall out of the playoff picture entirely</p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Tier 2: Playoff Hopefuls</h3>
              <div className="teams-grid">
                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>5. ankithe (5-4) - Playoff Probability: 82%</h4>
                  <p>3rd in the entire league in points scored (1259) is massive. Even at 5-4, they're the favorite for the wild card spot if they miss the top-5. A couple more wins with stable scoring and they're essentially locked in – they've got 2 avenues to the playoffs, record and points.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>6. swahili28 (4-5) - Playoff Probability: 58%</h4>
                  <p>The definition of unlucky with 1262 points scored (2nd overall) but only 4 wins. Currently hold the wild card spot on points, but need to win games to feel safe. The path is there.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>7. pranav4789 (4-5) - Playoff Probability: 55%</h4>
                  <p>4th in points scored (1257) while sitting at 4-5. Like swahili28, they're in prime wild card position but need wins to avoid getting jumped. The high scoring keeps them alive.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>8. abhishekD (5-4) - Playoff Probability: 45%</h4>
                  <p>Despite being 5-4, their 1176 points scored is concerning. Can't rely on the wild card, so they must win games to secure a top-5 spot outright. The margin for error is razor-thin. A couple more games like week 8 and they could be in the drivers seat</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>9. roshik (4-5) - Playoff Probability: 35%</h4>
                  <p>The 169-point explosion shows their ceiling, but 1182 points scored means they're currently outside the wild card picture. Need to win out and leapfrog into the top-5 directly.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Tier 3: Longshots</h3>
              <div className="teams-grid">
                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>10. akhilmetukuru (3-6) - Playoff Probability: 8%</h4>
                  <p>At 3-6 with 1086 points scored and the most points against (1307), they'd need to win every remaining game plus massive chaos. The math is nearly impossible.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>11. taahakm (3-6) - Playoff Probability: 5%</h4>
                  <p>Dead last in points scored (1029) at 3-6. Would need a five-game winning streak plus total chaos above them. Effectively eliminated from realistic contention.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>12. abhiu (2-7) - Playoff Probability: &lt;1%</h4>
                  <p>At 2-7 with 1099 points scored, there's no path to playoffs through wins or wild card. The season is over—time to play spoiler.</p>
