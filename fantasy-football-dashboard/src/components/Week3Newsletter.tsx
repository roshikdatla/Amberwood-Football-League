                  <h4>"JEFFERSON JUSTIFIED: Pranav Jain's Perfect Season Continues" pranavj20 (158.32) def. ankithe (125.37)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> pranavj20's 158 points were powered by a balanced attack. The trade acquisition of Lamar Jackson is paying massive dividends as this team looks unstoppable at 3-0.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> ankithe's 125 points were anchored by CMC's consistent 24.00 points, but it wasn't enough against the league's hottest team. This loss drops them from undefeated status but they remain dangerous.</p>

                  <h4>"KING HURTS RETURNS: Abhishek Bounces Back in Style" abhishekD (156.59) def. kulkdaddy47 (127.36)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> abhishekD's massive 156-point explosion represents the perfect bounce-back after Week 2's disaster. Jalen Hurts' masterclass in combination with 37.25 points from Vikings DST is an uphill battle for anyone to overcome.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> kulkdaddy47's 127 points show decent production, but they faced a motivated abhishekD team hungry for redemption. The championship experience couldn't overcome the opponent's desperation.</p>

                  <h4>"SUN GOD SHINES AGAIN: ARSB Powers Another Victory" pranav4789 (139.82) def. audumula (90.32)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> pranav4789's 139 points were driven by Amon-Ra St. Brown's excellent 20.70-point performance - his second strong game in three weeks. This team's ceiling remains among the league's highest.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> audumula's catastrophic 90 points represent their worst performance of the season. Multiple position groups failed simultaneously, creating a perfect storm of underperformance. With injuries littering the roster from top to bottom, the team will have to make some changes quickly</p>

                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> akhilmetukuru's 151 points represent their season-high and first victory! After two tough losses, this team finally put together a complete performance when they needed it most. The eagles WR duo really carried Akhil to a much needed win</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> taahakm's 135 points would have won several other matchups, but they faced a desperate opponent playing their best game. The 2-0 magic finally ran out.</p>

                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> roshik's 126 points show steady, if unspectacular, production. Kyren Williams anchored this victory with consistent ground game production.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> swahili28's 115 points continue their frustrating inconsistency. After Week 2's 176-point explosion, this team can't find their rhythm.</p>

                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> abhiu's season-worst 75.67 points represent the trade aftermath disaster. Without Lamar Jackson, this team is struggling to find consistent production at any position.</p>

              <p>Sometimes fantasy football isn't about having the best lineup - it's about having the best timing. SahitReddi takes home this week's Mickey Award not for embarrassment, but for catching the fantasy equivalent of finding a $20 bill on the sidewalk. With 125.57 points, they managed to secure their first victory of the season by facing the only team having a worse week than them.</p>

                  <li>Faced abhiu's season-low 75.67 points - The only team in the league they could beat this week</li>

                <h4>Why This is Peak Luck:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>This 125-point performance would have lost to literally every other team this week</li>
                  <li>abhiu's 75-point disaster was so bad it made SahitReddi look like championship contenders</li>
                  <li>Perfect timing to face a team in complete meltdown mode</li>
                  <li>Sometimes you don't need to play well, you just need your opponent to play worse</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Fortunate Timing:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Week 1: Lost to ankithe (123 vs 171) - faced a powerhouse</li>
                  <li>Week 2: Lost to ankithe (124 vs 171) - faced the same powerhouse again</li>
                  <li>Week 3: Beat abhiu (126 vs 76) - finally faced someone having a worse day</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This Mickey Award comes with a rabbit's foot keychain and a reminder that sometimes the fantasy football gods smile upon those who wait for their opponents to implode.</p>

              <div className="name-change-list">
                <p><strong>"Tudh Pushin' P" (Abhishek):</strong> Banking on Jalen Hurts' tush push reliability - seeking consistency after boom-bust performances</p>
                <p><strong>"Treylor Swift" (Anudeep):</strong> Creative triple-wordplay (DeAndre Swift + Trey McBride + Taylor Swift) trying to "shake off" that 90-point disaster</p>
                <p><strong>"Drake N' Bake" (Pranav P):</strong> Fully committing to Drake Maye's development. Like baking, this team is banking on elite rookies that may take time before they reach full potential</p>
                <p><strong>"Skatte-Bo Show" (Abhiram):</strong> Embracing the youth movement with Cam Skattebo + Bo Nix ‚Äì and a new QB running the show</p>

              <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Changing your team name won't change your record, but sometimes a fresh identity can provide the psychological boost needed for better decision-making going forward.</p>
