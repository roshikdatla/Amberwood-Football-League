                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>🔥 BLOWOUT OF THE WEEK: audumula Dominates pranavj20</h4>
                  <p><strong>audumula (173.28) def. pranavj20 (82.62)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> audumula delivered the most lopsided victory of the week, crushing pranavj20 by over 90 points in a statement win that solidifies their position atop the standings. Josh Allen exploded for 44.7 points in a vintage MVP performance. audumula walked away with the highest score of the week, reinforcing their status as the league's most dangerous team.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> pranavj20 suffered their worst defeat of the season, with even Jaxon Smith-Njigba unable to salvage what became a total disaster, dropping them into a five-way tie at 7-4 and raising serious questions about their playoff staying power. Absolutely shocking fall off from the team that was the consensus #1 for much of the year.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>💪 abhishekD Steamrolls akhilmetukuru</h4>
                  <p><strong>abhishekD (139.55) def. akhilmetukuru (56.04)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> abhishekD put on a clinic against the struggling akhilmetukuru, cruising to an 83-point victory behind Derrick Henry's workload and steady contributions across the roster. This dominant win keeps abhishekD firmly in the playoff race at 7-4, tied with four other teams in the tightest standings race we've seen all season.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> For akhilmetukuru, the nightmare continues as they drop to 3-8, scoring their second-lowest total of the season. With just three weeks remaining their playoff hopes are effectively extinguished.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>🎯 pranav4789 Outguns roshik</h4>
                  <p><strong>pranav4789 (163.99) def. roshik (100.15)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> In a high-scoring affair, pranav4789 flexed their offensive firepower with 163.99 points, powered by massive performances from TreVeyon Henderson (32.3 points), Christian Watson (20.6 points) and De'Von Achane (21.5 points). This left pranav4789 with the second-highest score of the week. This crucial victory keeps pranav4789's playoff hopes alive at 6-5, and more importantly, they continue to lead the league in points scored (1,594 PF), giving them the inside track for that coveted wildcard spot.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> roshik drops to 4-7 and their playoff dreams are all but extinguished as they fall three games back with limited time to make up ground.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>🚀 swahili28 Surges Past ankithe</h4>
                  <p><strong>swahili28 (154.47) def. ankithe (99.22)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> swahili28 delivered when it mattered most, posting 154.47 points behind an absolutely nuclear performance from George Pickens (29.40 points). James Cook added 20.4 points to create an unstoppable offensive juggernaut that demolished ankithe in the most consequential game of the week. This win vaults swahili28 to 6-5 and keeps them firmly in the playoff picture with the second-most points among 6-5 teams (1,547 PF).</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> For ankithe, this loss is devastating—they've plummeted five spots from third place all the way down to eighth, now sitting on the outside looking in and needing a miracle finish to salvage their playoff hopes despite having Christian McCaffrey, the most dominant player this season.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>⚔️ taahakm Edges abhiu</h4>
                  <p><strong>taahakm (142.52) def. abhiu (125.55)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> taahakm finally broke into the win column with a hard-fought 17-point victory over abhiu, as Jahmyr Gibbs (29.5 points) and Tetairoa McMillan (33 points) led the charge. While taahakm improves to 4-7 and keeps their mathematical playoff hopes technically alive, they'll need a miracle three-game winning streak and significant help to sneak into the top six.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> abhiu falls to 2-9 with the loss despite strong showings from Kenneth Gainwell (29.5 points), but with the season effectively over, they're already looking toward the future and building around their young core.</p>

                  <h4>🎲 kulkdaddy47 Squeaks By SahitReddi</h4>
                  <p><strong>kulkdaddy47 (108.49) def. SahitReddi (97.21)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> In the lowest-scoring game of the week, kulkdaddy47 held on for an 11-point victory over SahitReddi in what can only be described as a survival game. Neither team came close to their season averages, with both squads struggling to find offensive rhythm. Travis Kelce (24.10) did just enough to secure the win and maintain the 7-4 record for kulkdaddy47.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> This loss drops SahitReddi to 7-4, but they remain in second place in the standings thanks to their strong points-for total of 1,486, though this underwhelming performance raises concerns about whether they can maintain their playoff position down the stretch.</p>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <p><strong>Winner: kulkdaddy47 - The Escape Artist 🍀</strong></p>
                  <p>This week's Mickey Award goes to kulkdaddy47, who somehow managed to escape with a victory despite posting an embarrassing 108.49 points—the lowest winning score of Week 11 and a performance that would have lost to literally every other winning team this week.</p>
                  <p>Let's put this in perspective: kulkdaddy47 scored 108.49 points and won. This wasn't a competitive, back-and-forth battle. This was kulkdaddy47 limping across the finish line with one of their worst performances of the season and somehow finding a team in the league that performed even worse.</p>
                  <p>The only reason kulkdaddy47 survived was because SahitReddi had an equally disastrous week, posting just 97.21 points. Both teams combined for 205.7 points—barely more than what audumula scored by themselves (173.28). This was a race to see who could embarrass themselves less, and kulkdaddy47 won by default.</p>
                  <p>The kicker? This lucky escape keeps kulkdaddy47 at 7-4 and in fifth place in the playoff standings. They essentially backed into a crucial playoff-positioning win while scoring fewer points than five other teams that played this week.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations, kulkdaddy47. You're the Mickey of the Week. You didn't win—you just didn't lose as badly as the other guy. 🎪</p>

            <div className="matchup-result">
              <h4>Most Consequential Game: swahili28 vs. ankithe</h4>
              <p>The swahili28 victory over ankithe was hands down the most impactful result of Week 11, completely reshaping the playoff race in dramatic fashion. This wasn't just a win—it was a devastating blow to ankithe's playoff hopes while simultaneously breathing life into swahili28's postseason aspirations.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>ankithe's Historic Collapse:</strong> They entered Week 11 sitting comfortably in third place, but after losing to swahili28, they've plummeted five spots all the way down to eighth place. In a league where positions 1-8 are separated by just one game, this kind of freefall is catastrophic. ankithe went from controlling their own destiny in a top-three spot to suddenly being on the outside looking in.</li>
                <li><strong>swahili28's Surge:</strong> On the flip side, swahili28 kept their playoff dreams alive with this critical victory, improving to 6-5 with legitimate momentum. More importantly, their 1,547 PF now ranks second among 6-5 teams, giving them a strong wildcard insurance policy if they can't crack the top five.</li>
                <li><strong>Ripple Effects:</strong> With ankithe's fall, the playoff race has become even more chaotic. pranav4789 (6-5, 1,594 PF) and swahili28 (6-5, 1,547 PF) now have very clear paths to the postseason, while ankithe must essentially win out and hope for help.</li>

            <div className="power-rankings-section">
              <h3>THE PLAYOFF CRUNCH: SEPARATED BY INCHES</h3>
              <p>With just three weeks remaining in the regular season, positions 1-8 are separated by only one game, creating the tightest playoff race in league history. Five teams sit at 7-4, three teams at 6-5, and even the 4-7 teams haven't been mathematically eliminated yet.</p>

              <div className="teams-grid">
                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>1. audumula (7-4, 1,540 PF) - 95% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> vs. kulkdaddy47, abhishekd, vs. pranav4789</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The second-highest PF leader has the strongest position in the league, sitting atop the standings after their Week 11 demolition of pranavj20. With Josh Allen playing like an MVP and a loaded roster featuring CeeDee Lamb and Trey McBride, audumula controls their own destiny. Even at 8-6, their points-for total should secure at minimum a wildcard berth.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>2. SahitReddi (7-4, 1,486 PF) - 70% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Remaining Schedule:</strong> vs. pranavj20, ankithe, vs. abhiu</p>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Despite their Week 11 loss to kulkdaddy47, SahitReddi remains in excellent position, sitting in second place thanks to their strong points-for total. Bucky Irving should be returning from injury, which will provide a much-needed boost during the home stretch. Their 1,486 PF ranks third overall, meaning even if they slip to 8-6, they'd be the frontrunner for the wildcard spot.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>3. pranavj20 (7-4, 1,484 PF) - 70% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> After getting blown out by audumula in Week 11, pranavj20 dropped from the top but remains in prime position at 7-4. Lamar Jackson is one of the league's most valuable assets, and their receiving corps of Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba provides weekly upside. The concerning trend is their recent inconsistency—82 points in Week 11 was their worst performance of the season.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>4. abhishekD (7-4, 1,453 PF) - 65% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Coming off a dominant 139-point victory, abhishekD has momentum on their side. The combination of Derrick Henry's consistency and Jalen Hurts' dual-threat ability gives them a high floor. Their 1,453 PF ranks fourth among the 7-4 teams, putting them at a slight disadvantage in tiebreaker scenarios. If they can win 2 of their next 3 games they should be through to the playoffs comfortably.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>5. kulkdaddy47 (7-4, 1,400 PF) - 60% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Sitting in the fifth and final direct playoff spot, kulkdaddy47 holds the most precarious position among the 7-4 teams. While their record is solid, their 1,400 PF ranks fifth among the 7-4 teams AND behind 6-5 pranav4789 (1,594 PF), meaning they have the least margin for error. They likely need to win at least two of the next three games to stay out of wildcard territory.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>6. pranav4789 (6-5, 1,594 PF) - 85% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Currently on the outside looking in, pranav4789 actually has the 2nd best playoff odds thanks to one crucial factor: they lead ALL teams in points scored. With 1,594 PF, they're nearly 100 points ahead of the other playoff teams, meaning they'd secure a playoff spot regardless of record. The roster is loaded with Amon-Ra St. Brown, De'Von Achane, and Drake Maye providing weekly explosiveness. Barring a major scoring drought, pranav4789 should be very confident about their playoff chances.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>7. swahili28 (6-5, 1,547 PF) - 80% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fresh off a statement 154-point victory, swahili28 is surging at the right time. Their 1,547 PF ranks second overall, giving them a strong wildcard insurance policy. The path is clear: win one of their next three games while maintaining their high scores and they're in the playoffs. Even at 7-7, their points-for total should secure the sixth spot if other contenders falter.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="team-card">
                  <h4>8. ankithe (6-5, 1,504 PF) - 65% PLAYOFF CHANCE</h4>
                  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Sitting in eighth place after a devastating five-spot drop from third, ankithe faces a tough road ahead. The loss to swahili28 was catastrophic, sending them from a comfortable playoff position to suddenly fighting for their postseason lives. Their 1,504 PF ranks 4th overall, meaning they are in a good spot for tiebreakers, but likely need to finish 8-6 or hope for chaos above them.</p>

                <p><strong>Betting Line:</strong> audumula -8.5</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is the marquee matchup of Week 12, pitting the league's top scorer against a fellow 7-4 contender fighting to maintain their playoff position. audumula enters as the favorite behind Josh Allen's elite play and a receiving corps that can explode any week. kulkdaddy47 will counter with Patrick Mahomes and DK Metcalf, but their recent 108-point performance raises concerns about consistency. Expect a high-scoring affair, with audumula's superior points-for average (140 PPG) giving them the edge.</p>

                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a must-win for both teams, with abhishekD looking to protect their 7-4 record and pranav4789 needing wins to climb into the top six. The matchup features two of the league's most explosive offenses, with Amon-Ra St. Brown going head-to-head against Derrick Henry. pranav4789's 145 PPG scoring average gives them a slight edge, and their motivation as the team on the outside looking in could provide the extra push. This game will likely come down to the final Sunday night or Monday games—absolute must-watch material.</p>

                <h4>Desperation Bowl: roshik vs. akhilmetukuru</h4>
                <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> roshik 118, akhilmetukuru 92</p>
                <p><strong>Betting Line:</strong> roshik -11.5</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Two eliminated teams looking to play spoiler, but roshik has the significant advantage with Saquon Barkley leading the way. akhilmetukuru has been one of the league's most disappointing teams, and their 56-point Week 11 showing was rock bottom. roshik should cruise here, though stranger things have happened in fantasy football.</p>

                <h4>Trap Game Alert: ankithe vs. abhiu</h4>
                <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> ankithe 121, abhiu 105</p>
                <p><strong>Betting Line:</strong> ankithe -9.5</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> ankithe absolutely cannot afford a slip-up here against the 2-9 abhiu, but this is exactly the type of trap game that derails playoff hopes. ankithe's elite play from CMC should carry them, but abhiu has Justin Jefferson and could catch lightning in a bottle if JJ goes nuclear. The smart money is on ankithe taking care of business, but if they lay an egg here, their playoff chances are all but done.</p>

                <p><strong>Betting Line:</strong> swahili28 -13.5</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> swahili28 comes in riding high after their 154-point Week 11 explosion, and they'll look to keep the momentum going against a struggling 4-7 taahakm squad. Ja'Marr Chase is playing at an elite level, and the James Cook/Travis Etienne duo gives them a massive RB advantage. swahili28 is fighting for their playoff lives and should handle business convincingly here.</p>

                <h4>Battle of Contenders: SahitReddi vs. pranavj20</h4>

                <p><strong>Betting Line:</strong> pranavj20 -5.5</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Two 7-4 teams collide in what could be a playoff preview. SahitReddi's backfield with Bijan gives them a strong floor, but pranavj20's Lamar Jackson is a difference-maker who can take over games single-handedly. Both teams are coming off disappointing Week 11 performances, so whoever bounces back first will likely take this one. The slight edge goes to pranavj20, as Lamar's ceiling is simply higher than anything SahitReddi can counter with.</p>

              <h3>🏁 THE FINAL STRETCH</h3>
              <p>Week 12 will be absolute chaos. With five teams at 7-4, three teams at 6-5, and multiple playoff-impacting matchups, we're about to see the playoff picture crystallize. The margin for error is razor-thin, and a single loss could send a team tumbling from a top-five spot into wildcard territory—or worse, out of the playoffs entirely.</p>
              <p><strong>Buckle up, Amberwood Football League. The next three weeks will determine champions and crush dreams. Welcome to playoff football.</strong></p>
