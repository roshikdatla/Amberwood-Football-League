                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"CMC GOES NUCLEAR: Ankithe Demolishes Pranav P with Historic Performance" ankithe (186.14) def. pranav4789 (113.73)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> In the performance of the season, ankithe exploded for 186 points powered by Christian McCaffrey's absolutely ridiculous 39.10-point masterpiece. This wasn't just a win - this was a statement that ankithe is back and dangerous. The 186 total is the highest score of the entire season, and CMC's 39 points represents one of the best single-player performance all year. Moving to 4-3 keeps playoff hopes very much alive.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> pranav4789's 113 points is their worst performance in weeks, coming at the absolute worst time. Dropping to 3-4 puts them squarely on the playoff bubble despite having the 3rd-highest points for (995) in the league. This is the kind of loss that could haunt them when tiebreakers matter.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"SAHIT'S SURGE CONTINUES: Five Straight Wins and Rolling" SahitReddi (161.07) def. swahili28 (136.46)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> SahitReddi's 161-point performance extends their winning streak to FIVE games (170 ‚Üí 146 ‚Üí 135 ‚Üí 161 ‚Üí 161). From 0-2 to 5-2, this is the hottest team in the league and they're peaking at the perfect time. At 5-2 with 969 points for (2nd in league), they're a legitimate championship threat.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> swahili28's 136 points is respectable but not enough against red-hot SahitReddi. Dropping to 4-3 keeps them in playoff position but the loss to a direct competitor hurts. Ja'Marr Chase and the massive performance couldn't save them.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"ADITYA SURVIVES SCARE: Escapes Roshik with Narrow Victory" kulkdaddy47 (152.74) def. roshik (123.83)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> kulkdaddy47's 152 points bounce back nicely from last week's disaster. Patrick Mahomes and the core delivered when needed, moving them to 4-3 and keeping playoff hopes alive. This is the kind of win that matters in a tight race.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> roshik's 123 points keeps them in striking distance but dropping to 2-5 makes playoffs nearly impossible. They're running out of time and need to win basically every remaining game to have a shot.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 style={{fontSize: '20px', textDecoration: 'underline'}}>‚öîÔ∏è Shocking Upsets</h3>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"ABHIRAM'S MIRACLE: First Win Comes Against Abhishek!" abhiu (151.86) def. abhishekD (101.04)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> After six straight losses and an 0-6 start, abhiu FINALLY gets their first win with a season-high 151 points! The roster showed signs of life at the perfect time, beating a playoff contender. This win means everything for morale even if playoffs are out of reach.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> abhishekD's catastrophic 101-point performance is their second disaster in 2 weeks (89 ‚Üí 101). Across the board mediocre performances with only double digits being scored by Jalen Hurts and Seahwaks DST destroyed any chance of competing. Dropping to 3-4, the playoff path that looked clear two weeks ago is now in serious jeopardy. This is the boom-bust nightmare scenario ‚Äì having a stinker against the last place team in the league.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"AKHIL STEALS ANOTHER: Beats Anudeep by 1.30 Points!" akhilmetukuru (159.39) def. audumula (158.09)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> In the closest game of the week, akhilmetukuru won by just 1.30 points with a season-high 159-point explosion. Moving to 3-4 keeps them alive in the playoff race. This is the kind of statement win that can spark a run.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> audumula's heartbreaking 158-point loss is devastating. That total would have won four other matchups this week. Dropping to 4-3, they're still in good position but this hurts. Every loss matters in a tight race, and losing with 158 points is brutal.</p>
                </div>

              <div className="story-column">

                  <h4>"PRANAV JAIN HOLDS SERVE: Survives Taaha's Challenge" pranavj20 (135.09) def. taahakm (106.02)</h4>
                  <p><strong>Winner Analysis:</strong> pranavj20's 135 points maintains their league-best 6-1 record. While not their most impressive win, staying ahead of the pack matters. With 1009 points for (1st in league), they remain the clear favorite.</p>
                  <p><strong>Loser Analysis:</strong> taahakm's 106 points continues their low-ceiling struggles. Dropping to 3-4, their playoff hopes are fading fast. The 832 points for (11th in league) shows this team lacks the firepower to make a serious run.</p>

                <div className="matchup-result">
                  <h4>"Winner": abhishekD (Abhishek) - The Spectacular Collapse</h4>
                  <p>abhishekD takes home this week's Mickey Award not for luck, but for achieving something truly remarkable: back-to-back disaster weeks culminating in losing to the league's 0-6 team. This is the kind of implosion that ends seasons. Back to back weeks with the lowest score in the league calls for this special Mickey of the Week ‚Äì ultimate shame edition</p>
                  <p><strong>The Brutal Reality:</strong> This wasn't just a bad week - this could be a season-defining disaster. Losing to the 0-6 team after posting 89 and 101 points in consecutive weeks shows this team is in complete free-fall. The boom-bust pattern has become all bust, and playoff hopes are dwindling</p>
                  <p><strong>The Championship Path That Died:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Week 1: 166 points (looked like a juggernaut)</li>
                    <li>Week 3: 156 points (championship ceiling!)</li>
                    <li>Week 5: 145 points (still dangerous)</li>
                    <li>Week 6: 89 points (uh oh...)</li>
                    <li>Week 7: 101 points (season over?)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Maybe this award will serve as a chip on the team's shoulder as they make a comeback to being playoff relevant again. They have built their brand on being Boom/Bust this year, but if the past two weeks are an indicator of anything moving forward.. close your eyes.</p>
                  <p><strong>Previous Mickey Awards:</strong> Given to lucky teams. This one is for pure, unfiltered shame.</p>

              <p><strong>Current State:</strong> An unprecedented 10 out of 12 teams sit between 4-3 and 3-4, creating the tightest playoff race in league history. Only pranavj20 (6-1) and SahitReddi (5-2) have separated themselves.</p>

                <li><strong>Points For Will Decide Everything:</strong> The 64-point spread between ankithe (999) and audumula (935) could be the difference between playoffs and elimination. In a race where all four teams likely finish 7-7 or 8-6, every single point matters for tiebreakers.</li>
                <li><strong>The Math:</strong> All four teams need 4 wins in final 7 games to reach 8-6. That's a 4-3 finish - very achievable but zero margin for error.</li>
